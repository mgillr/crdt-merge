## [0.9.6] — E4 Hardening Release

Stubs replaced with real cryptography. Zero breaking changes.

### Added
- **Real Ed25519 signature verification** via the `cryptography` package (optional dep)
- `configure_ed25519_verification(registry)` — public API to enable real crypto
- **Observer authentication** on `TrustEvidence` via `observer_signing_fn` parameter
- **Timestamp binding** on evidence with `max_age_seconds` replay protection
- `configure_evidence_verification(registry)` — enforce evidence source validation
- **Real NIST ML-DSA-65** post-quantum signatures via liboqs (optional dep)
- `Dilithium3Scheme` class using the NIST PQC reference implementation
- `KeyPair` now uses real Ed25519 when cryptography is available
- `RevocationEntry.verify(registry=...)` validates real signatures over structured payload

### Changed
- `DilithiumLite` honestly documented as hash-based, NOT post-quantum (`security_level` 192 -> 128)
- `verification_level()` now rounds to 12 decimal places to prevent float boundary bugs
- Key rotation and emergency revoke now sign structured revocation payloads

### Fixed
- Float precision bug in `verification_level()` at exact 0.8 boundary (was returning level 0, now level 1)
- Float precision bug at exact 0.4 boundary (was returning level 2, now level 1)

### Security
- Signature verification no longer accepts any 64-byte blob when a registry is configured
- Evidence source cryptographically verified when registry is configured
- Replay attacks on stale evidence blocked via `max_age_seconds` parameter
- Revocation entries require valid signatures from the revoked key

### Test additions
- +16 Ed25519 verification tests (`tests/e4/test_pco_ed25519.py`)
- +14 observer authentication tests (`tests/e4/test_proof_evidence_auth.py`)
- +14 post-quantum tests (`tests/e4/resilience/test_pq_signatures_real.py`)
- +14 key ownership tests (`tests/e4/resilience/test_key_ownership.py`)
- +5 origin binding tests (`tests/e4/test_trust_delta_origin.py`)
- +15 battle-hardened attack tests (`tests/e4/test_hardening_attacks.py`)
- +11 real safetensors end-to-end tests (`tests/e4/test_real_safetensors_e4.py`)
- **Net: +90 tests, zero regressions.** Nord SNN (129) and AIPG (49) integrations continue passing.

## Version 0.9.5 — E4 Recursive Trust-Delta Architecture

**Release date:** April 2026
**Branch:** `feature/0.9.5-e4-recursive-entanglement`
**Tag:** `v0.9.5-e4`

### Breaking Changes

**NONE.**

E4 is a fully additive upgrade. All existing crdt-merge 0.9.4 code, protocols, and deployments continue to work without modification. The dual-hash compatibility layer ensures zero-downtime migration. See [Integration Guide §3](E4-INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md#3-zero-downtime-migration).

### New Capabilities

#### Recursive Trust-Delta Architecture
- Trust changes propagate as `ProjectionDelta`s through the same two-layer pipeline as application data
- Four entanglement points (E1–E4) create recursive dependencies between trust, integrity, causality, and verification
- Self-healing: misbehaviour generates evidence → trust decreases → verification increases → further misbehaviour caught faster

#### Multi-Dimensional Trust
- Six trust dimensions: integrity, causality, consistency, gossip, model, context
- GCounter-based evidence tracking per observer per dimension
- Trust is a CRDT: commutative, associative, idempotent merge

#### Proof-Carrying Evidence
- Five evidence types with cryptographic proofs
- Any honest node can verify evidence independently (Byzantine-fault-tolerant)
- Proof helpers: `pack_attestation_pair`, `pack_merkle_path`, `pack_clock_pair`, `pack_delta_proof`, `pack_state_pair`

#### Aggregate PCO (128-byte proofs)
- Single proof covers integrity, causality, trust, and minimality
- Constant overhead per operation (128 bytes) regardless of complexity
- Four verification levels with adaptive cost

#### Trust-Bound Merkle Tree
- High-arity design: B=256 branching factor, depth 4 for 1B parameters
- Trust-dependent hashes at leaf and intermediate levels
- Dual-hash mode for backward compatibility

#### Causal Trust Clock
- Vector clock entries carry (time, trust) pairs
- Trust-weighted comparison: `trust_override` outcome
- CRDT merge: element-wise max preserving join-semilattice

#### Adaptive Immune Verification
- Four-tier gating: O(1) for trusted, O(k) for untrusted, reject for quarantined
- Async verification queue for optimistic acceptance
- Self-adjusting: trust changes drive verification level changes

#### Circuit Breaker
- Trust velocity monitoring with configurable σ threshold
- Auto-reset after cooldown period
- Protects against coordinated swarm attacks

#### Homeostatic Budget Conservation
- Total trust per dimension conserved: `sum(trust_d) == peer_count`
- Prevents trust inflation/deflation attacks
- Preserves rank ordering (relative trust unchanged)

#### Zero-Downtime Migration
- `CompatibilityController` negotiates per-peer modes
- `CompatHandshake` protocol for capability exchange
- Three modes: E4_ONLY, DUAL_HASH, LEGACY_ONLY
- Full rollback support without data loss

---

### Migration Notes from 0.9.4

#### Recommended Migration Path

1. **Upgrade to 0.9.5** — no code changes required
2. **Enable E4 in dual-hash mode** — `E4Config(compatibility_mode="dual_hash")`
3. **Monitor** — check `compat.peer_count_by_mode()` and trust health
4. **Upgrade all peers** — ensure all peers support E4
5. **Switch to E4-only** — `E4Config(compatibility_mode="e4_only")`

#### Configuration Defaults

All defaults are production-safe:
- Probation trust: 0.5
- Circuit breaker: 2σ threshold, 30s cooldown
- Merkle branching factor: 256
- Homeostasis: enabled
- Compatibility: e4_only (set to "dual_hash" during migration)

#### Import Changes

E4 is a new subpackage — no existing imports change:

```python
# Existing imports unchanged
from crdt_merge import ...  # still works

# New E4 imports (additive)
from crdt_merge.e4 import TypedTrustScore, TrustEvidence, ProjectionDelta
from crdt_merge.e4.delta_trust_lattice import DeltaTrustLattice
from crdt_merge.e4.integration.config import E4Config, set_config
```

---

### New Dependencies

**NONE.**

E4 uses only the Python standard library:
- `hashlib` (SHA-256)
- `struct` (binary packing)
- `dataclasses`
- `collections` (deque)
- `typing`
- `time` (monotonic clock)

Ed25519 signing is injected as a callback — bring your own crypto library.

---

### Test Coverage

- 8 test modules covering all 15 E4 modules
- Integration tests for full E4 stack wiring
- Compatibility tests for all three modes
- Convergence tests for CRDT merge properties
- Circuit breaker trip/reset tests
- Evidence verification tests for all five types
- Gossip, streaming, and agent bridge tests
